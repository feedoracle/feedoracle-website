## Attestations vs Memory Layer

**Memory Layer** = historical snapshots & verification endpoints.

**Attestations** = on-chain receipts for specific snapshots.

1 attestation = one anchored receipt for a feed state at a specific time.

Attestations prove what was delivered when — they do not certify underlying data accuracy.
