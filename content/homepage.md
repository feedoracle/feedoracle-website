## Value Propositions

### Structured Data Feeds
Real-time and historical data across RWA tokenization, carbon metrics, macroeconomic indicators, and energy statistics. Every response includes standardized provenance metadata.

### Cryptographic Receipts
DAP (Disclosure Attestation Protocol) anchors snapshot receipts on-chain. Prove what was reported and when—without claiming truth of underlying data.

### Audit-Ready Evidence
DORA-supporting controls with documented incident management, SLO tracking, and third-party registers. Evidence packages (sanitized) for procurement teams.
